# NGINX Configuration Manager - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Full-stack NGINX configuration management system with web UI for creating, managing, and deploying real NGINX configurations from structured database data.

## Database Design Understanding

### Core NGINX Concepts Mapped to Database Entities

**Upstream Entity**
Represents NGINX upstream directive - a group of backend servers for load balancing. Each upstream defines a cluster of servers that NGINX can proxy requests to. The `name` field becomes the upstream block identifier, `server` contains backend server addresses, `keepAlive` sets connection persistence, and health check fields manage server availability monitoring.

**Certificate Entity** 
Stores SSL/TLS certificates and private keys used for HTTPS termination. NGINX needs both certificate and private key files to enable SSL. The `expiresAt` field enables proactive certificate renewal, `issuer` tracks certificate authority, and `autoRenew` flag enables automatic renewal workflows.

**Domain Entity**
Represents domain names that NGINX will serve. These map to `server_name` directives in NGINX configuration. A single domain can be used across multiple server blocks and can have multiple certificates (for different subdomains or wildcard scenarios).

**HttpServer Entity**
Core entity representing an NGINX server block - the fundamental configuration unit that defines how NGINX handles requests for specific domains and ports. Contains server-level configurations like logging paths, custom directives, and operational status.

**ListeningPort Entity**
Represents network ports that NGINX listens on. Maps to `listen` directives in server blocks. Supports both HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports, as well as custom ports for specific services.

**Location Entity**
Represents NGINX location blocks within server contexts. Defines how NGINX handles requests to specific URL patterns. Can proxy to upstreams, serve static files, or apply custom configurations like rate limiting and access controls.

**ServerDomainMapping**
Junction table linking servers to domains - enables one server block to handle multiple domains, or one domain to be served by multiple server configurations (for different contexts or load balancing).

**CertificateDomainMapping** 
Links certificates to domains they're valid for. Supports multi-domain certificates (SAN certificates) and wildcard certificates that cover multiple subdomains.

**ConfigVersion**
Stores historical NGINX configuration snapshots for each server. Enables rollback capabilities, configuration auditing, and change tracking. The `isActive` flag marks which configuration version is currently deployed.

**AccessRule**
Defines IP-based access control rules that translate to NGINX `allow`/`deny` directives. Can be applied at server level (affects entire virtual host) or location level (affects specific URL patterns).

### Relationship Patterns

**One-to-Many Relationships**
- HttpServer to Location (one server can have multiple location blocks)
- HttpServer to ConfigVersion (one server has multiple configuration versions over time)
- Upstream to Location (one upstream can serve multiple location blocks)

**Many-to-Many Relationships**
- HttpServer to ListeningPort (servers can listen on multiple ports, ports can serve multiple servers)
- Certificate to Domain (certificates can cover multiple domains, domains can have multiple certificates)
- HttpServer to Domain (servers can handle multiple domains, domains can be served by multiple servers)

**Hierarchical Structure**
The configuration follows NGINX's hierarchical structure: HttpServer (server block) contains Location blocks (location contexts), with global entities (Upstream, Certificate, Domain) referenced as needed.
